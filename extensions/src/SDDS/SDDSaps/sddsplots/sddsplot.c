 the SDDS file, it output will take that format_string for output.

 2) Fixed a problem that when multiple file with multiple pages are plotted with -split=page -order=Spectral and eachpage keyword is used in -graphic option, only part of the spectra is actually used in the plot.

 * Revision 1.4  1995/09/25  16:39:18  borland
 * Changed adjust_sddsplot_overlay_data to return 0/1 if overlay not possible/
 * possible.  Added warning message to sparse_sample_clip if all data is removed
 * by winnowing.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  1995/09/14  22:04:25  borland
 * Added support for yimpulse and ybar graphic types.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  1995/09/05  21:09:40  saunders
 * First test release of the SDDS1.5 package.
