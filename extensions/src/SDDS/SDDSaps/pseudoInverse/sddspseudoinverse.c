/* Program sddspseudoinverse
 * Reads a sddsfile with one data set.
 * Finds all numerical columns and rows, and
 * makes a matrix out of them.
 * Finds the pseudo-inverse, and make a new data set.
 * The data in the first string column becomes the names of the columns in the output file.
 * The names of the columns of the input file become data for the string column of the output file.
 *
 * Added nlargestsingularvalues 2/20/95
 * Added calls to the meschach library from netlib. 7/12/95
 * The original non-meschach version used a call to a function
 * derived from a routine in "Numerical Recipes in C". Since code
 * from this book isn't free, the original version of sddspseudoinverse 
 * can't be distributed outside the lab.

 Revision 1.56  2008/04/22 19:38:44  shang
 removed the unnecessary print statement.

 Revision 1.55  2008/04/22 18:03:36  shang
 added -multiplyMatrix option to muliply the inverse matrix by multiply matrix or multiply the multiply matrix by the inverse and output the product matrix.

 Revision 1.53  2008/04/16 16:43:46  shang
 fixed the bug in setting SingularValuesUsed array and simpiled the coding of reading input file layout.

 Revision 1.52  2008/04/16 15:20:59  soliday
 Fixed issues with building CLAPACK version on Solaris.

 Revision 1.51  2008/04/11 21:29:27  emery
 No longer use the general lapack written in C.
 No more references to f2c.h; f2c_ is removed as prefix to dgemm.
 Code for LAPACK and CLAPACK are now different (doublereal is no
 longer defined when flag CLAPCK is used.)
 Compilation flag LAPACK is used only for plain lapack that
 is installed by default in Fedora Core.
 Added the comment that cblas_dgemm, which is available in
 ATLAS, could be used instead of dgemm_ in a later version.
 Fixed a bug in multiplication where the correct range of internal index
 was not calculated, i.e. MIN(rows,numericalColumns)

 Revision 1.50  2008/01/22 22:58:11  shang
 fixed a bug in allocating and assigning of R->me matrix  which caused core dump error when multiplying it with weight vector
 in case that number of columns is more than number of rows and corrected the weighting factor. (for CLAPACK and LAPACK only)

 Revision 1.49  2007/10/11 17:35:01  emery
 Added -printPackage which will print out to stderr the linear algebra
 package used in compilation. Warning of "-economy not available" is
 now removable by user with the -noWarning option.

 Revision 1.48  2007/10/10 09:33:09  emery
 Force the variable economy to zero when it is not available
 from the compilation FLAGS. Added variable economyRows for
 setting the number of rows for the s-matrix. Compliation and results
 for u, s matrices checked with no flags and with SUNPERF enabled.

 Revision 1.47  2007/10/10 08:45:26  emery
 I believe that the singular values written out as a matrix
 should have the number of rows equal to the number of
 numerical columns.

 Revision 1.46  2007/06/07 22:10:05  emery
 Fixed a bug concerning deleting vectors and reconstruction.
 The problem was that it was assumed that vectors were deleted
 at the end of the list of singular values and vectors.
 This stopped being the case when -deleteVactor option
 was introduced. Replaced the index limit NSVUsed with
 variable numericalColumns in several loops.

 Revision 1.45  2007/06/07 21:09:13  emery
 Allow deletion of first vector, previously prevented on
 purpose. User beware.

 Revision 1.44  2006/12/14 22:23:40  soliday
 AutoCheckMode is turned off by default now so I removed calls to
 SDDS_SetAutoCheckMode that would attempt to turn it off. It is now up to
 the programmer to turn it on in new programs until debugging is completed
 and then remove the call to SDDS_SetAutoCheckMode.

 Revision 1.43  2006/08/24 21:22:52  soliday
 Updated to work with CLAPACK on WIN32

 Revision 1.42  2006/08/07 18:46:58  emery
 Spelling correction in comment. Added space after a comma in arguments.

 Revision 1.41  2006/03/22 21:59:19  shang
 added more usage to economy option to encourage people to use it.

 Revision 1.40  2006/03/22 21:38:09  shang
 tests found that other computation cost is about the same as that of svd; modified to
 use the matrix directly from svd (avoid matrix transposes) and use dgemm for matrix multiplication. This speeds the computation by 3 times for smaller matrix, and 11 times for matrix 10000 x 1000 matrix.

 Revision 1.39  2005/11/17 17:13:39  soliday
 Cleaned up the code a little.

 Revision 1.38  2005/11/04 22:46:35  soliday
 Updated code to be compiled by a 64 bit processor.

 Revision 1.37  2005/08/30 21:30:40  soliday
 Updated to be able to compile on WIN32.

 Revision 1.36  2005/07/17 04:01:43  emery
 Moved flag economy of uMatrix to the general line options.
 Declared register x for all SVD methods.
 Added clarifying comments on which svd methods use U or Ut.
 Used economy switch to change the allocation size of U for SunPerf,
 LAPACK and CLAPACK. (The economy switch was used only to
 make the calculation of U limited to the minimum of number
 of rows and columns. Make Ut use U memory in the cases
 of LAPACK adn CLAPACK. Added more matrix printout in
 very verbose option. For calculating Rinvt, made LAPACK
 and CLAPACK use the same commands as Meschach.
 For U matrix printout, used variable U->n or Ut->M instead
 of rows for clarity. Made LAPACK
 and CLAPACK use the same commands for writing U and for calculating
 reconstruction matrix as Meschach.
 Rewrote how the martices are freed at the end of writing.
 Somehow there were difference for U (Ut) wether a file was being written
 or not. Still need to check how the memory allocation
 works for multi-page files. Leave that for Shang.
 Checked results for Meschach, SunPerf, CLAPACK and Numerical
 Recipes with and without economy using very verbose.

 Revision 1.35  2005/07/14 18:09:39  emery
 Added compilation flags for LAPACK (i.e. fortran)
 and CLAPACK calls to svd. So far they are the same code.
 Added economy option for uMatrix option. The economy
 options works for LAPACK-based calls, which are LAPACK, CLAPACK and SunPerf.
 It may be applied to meschach in the future.
 Economy is always the case for numerical recipes in C.
 Added summary of which compication flag corresponds to which svd call.
 Made separate StartTable calls for sPage dataset depending on
 matrix output or single column output.

 Revision 1.34  2004/04/27 18:22:39  shang
 the NumberOfSingularValuesUsed parameter now records the actual number of singular values
 used; And fixed the problem that define parameters which already exists

 Revision 1.33  2004/04/26 21:32:19  shang
 fixed the bug that the -smallestSingularValues option in previous version
 actually removed the largest (should be the smallest) singular values.

 Revision 1.32  2004/04/26 19:20:51  shang
 added -smallestSingularValues options to remove the last smallestSingularValues

 Revision 1.31  2004/04/12 23:29:32  shang
 removed the "-removeDCVectors" option from usage

 Revision 1.30  2004/04/07 18:09:33  shang
 removed compiler warnings under linux

 Revision 1.29  2004/03/30 19:06:29  shang
 added -deleteVectors option and write the biggest singular value, deleted vectors
 as parameters to output file

 Revision 1.28  2004/02/11 09:19:53  borland
 Added option to sFile to allow outputing the singular values as a diagonal
 matrix.

 Revision 1.27  2003/09/02 19:41:10  soliday
 Cleaned up code for Linux.

 Revision 1.26  2002/08/14 17:32:36  soliday
 Added Open License

 Revision 1.25  2002/07/29 22:37:08  borland
 Changed per L. Emery to resolve problem with setting a row past the end of
 the S-values file.

 Revision 1.24  2002/02/20 18:55:16  soliday
 Fixed a memory bug when using -uMatrix

 Revision 1.23  2001/09/26 21:02:37  soliday
 Added the ability to use the Sun Performance library on Solaris.

 Revision 1.22  2001/09/13 22:05:29  emery
 Included the first SV in determining min and max SV.

 Revision 1.21  2001/06/08 21:29:01  emery
 Removed compilation flag MESCHACH, and removed the old alternative to
 MESCHACH library. Added a compilation flag for another alternative to
 MESCHACH code, the Numerical Recipes in C in-situ SVD code. (The
 numerical recipes code is not provided since it is not free code. The
 user must have a license to use numerical recipes code.)  Added better
 memory management in SDDS arrays to allow the inversion of vary large
 matrices. A function for explicitly freeing memory in an SDDS data set
 has been added.

 Revision 1.20  2001/03/23 21:53:17  soliday
 Updated usage message to work with WIN32.

 Revision 1.19  2001/03/03 12:32:09  emery

 Revision 1.12  1998/04/13 20:59:31  emery
 Removed the meschach functions from the code since they are now a library.

 Revision 1.11  1998/03/23 21:53:54  emery
 Fixed a bug in calculating the condition number introduced
 with the removeDCVectors option.

 Revision 1.10  1998/03/23 19:14:57  emery
 Added option removeDCVectors which removed the orthogonal
 vectors with average > 0.1 sqrt(N). THis does
 not affect the v file output.

 Revision 1.9  1998/03/01 09:52:06  emery
 Added options to write output file for u and v matrices.
 For meschach calls, the difference in convention is
 made clearer.

 Revision 1.8  1998/02/17 23:43:06  emery

SunPerf is an alternative to Num. Rec. and Meschach on solaris.
SunPerf library is an implementation of LAPACK. It has C-interface
library calls. That's why we don't see the _ postfix on dgesvd below.
CLAPACK is a C version of fortran LAPACK.
CLAPACK may use ATLAS, an automatically tuned version of basic algebra functions.
LAPACK is plain lapack now installed in linux systems.
