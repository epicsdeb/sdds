\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf description:}

{\tt sddspeakfind} finds the locations and values of peaks in a single column of an SDDS file.  It incorporates
various features to help reject spurious peaks.  The column is considered a function of the row index for the
purpose of finding peaks.  Hence, the data should be sorted if necessary using {\tt sddssort} prior to using this
program.  I.e., if the data contains columns x and y, and one wants x values of peaks in y, then one should
ensure that the rows are sorted into increasing or decreasing x order.

It may also be helpful to smooth the data using {\tt sddssmooth} in order to eliminate spurious peaks due to
noisy data.

\item {\bf examples:} 
Find peaks in a Fourier transform:
\begin{flushleft}{\tt
sddspeakfind data.fft data.peaks -column=FFTamplitude 
}\end{flushleft}
Sort and smooth the data first:
\begin{flushleft}{\tt
sddssort data.fft -column=f,increasing -pipe=out \\
| sddssmooth -pipe -columns=FFTamplitude \\
| sddspeakfind -pipe=in data.peaks -column=FFTamplitude 
}\end{flushleft}

\item {\bf synopsis:} 
\begin{flushleft}{\tt
sddspeakfind [-pipe=[input][,output]] [{\em inputFile}] [{\em outputFile}] 
-column={\em columnName} [-fivePoints] [-threshold={\em value}]
[-exclusionZone={\em fractionalInterval}] [-changeThreshold={\em fractionalChange}]
}\end{flushleft}
\item {\bf files:}
{\em inputFile} contains the data to be searched for peaks.  {\em outputFile} contains all of the array and
parameter data from {\em inputFile}, plus data from all rows that contain a peak in the named column.  No new
data elements are created.  If {\em inputFile} contains multiple pages, each is treated separately and is
delivered to a separate page of {\em outputFile}.

\item {\bf switches:}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \verb|-pipe[=input][,output]| --- The standard SDDS Toolkit pipe option.
    \item {\tt -column={\em columnName}} --- Specifies the name of the column to search for peaks. 
    \item {\tt -fivePoints} --- Specifies peak analysis using five adjacent data points, rather than
        the default three.  For three-point mode, a peak is any point which is larger than both of
        its two nearest neighbors.  For five-point mode, the candidate point's nearest neighbors must in turn
        be higher than their nearest neighbors on the side away from the candidate point.
    \item {\tt -threshold={\em value}} --- Specifies a minimum value that a peak value must exceed in order
        to be included in the output.  By default, no threshold is applied.
    \item {\tt -exclusionZone={\em fractionalInterval}} --- Specifies elimination of smaller peaks within a given interval
        around a larger peak.  {\em fractionalInterval} is the width of the interval in units of the length of the data table.
    \item {\tt -changeThreshold={\em fractionalChange}} --- Specifies elimination of peaks for which the fractional
        change between the peak value and the nearest neighbor points is less than the given amount.  If 
        {\tt -fivePoints} is given, the nearest neighbors in question are those 2 rows above and below the
        peak.
