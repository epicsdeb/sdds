\label{sddscorrelate}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf description:} 
{\tt sddscorrelate} computes correlation coefficients and correlation
significance between column data.  The correlation coefficient between
columns i and j is defined as
\[ {\rm C_{ij} = \frac{\langle (x_i-\langle x_i \rangle) (x_j-\langle x_j \rangle)\rangle}
{\sqrt{\langle (x_i-\langle x_i \rangle)^2\rangle \langle (x_j - \langle x_j \rangle)^2 \rangle}}} \]
If ${\rm C_{ij}=1}$, then the variables are perfectly correlated, whereas if ${\rm C_{ij}=-1}$, they
are perfectly anticorrelated.
The correlation significance is the probability that the observed correlation coefficient could happen
by chance if the variables were in fact uncorrelated.  Hence, a very small correlation significance
means that the variables are probably correlated.
\item {\bf examples:}
Find the correlations among beam-position-monitor x values in {\tt par.bpm}:
\begin{flushleft}{\tt
sddscorrelate par.bpm par.cor -column='*x' 
}\end{flushleft}
Find the correlations of these readouts with one specific readout only:
\begin{flushleft}{\tt
sddscorrelate par.bpm par.cor -column='*x' -withOnly=P1P1x
}\end{flushleft}
\item {\bf synopsis:}
\begin{flushleft}{\tt
sddscorrelate [-pipe=[input][,output]] [{\em inputFile}] [{\em outputFile}] 
[-columns={\em columnNames}] [-excludeColumns={\em columnNames}] 
[-withOnly={\em columnName}] [-rankOrder]
[-stDevOutlier[=limit={\em factor}][,passes={\em integer}]]
}\end{flushleft}
\item {\bf files:}
        {\em inputFile} is an SDDS file containing two or more columns of data.  For each page of
        the file, {\em outputFile} contains the correlation coefficients and significance for
        every possible pairing of variables requested.  {\em outputFile} also contains three string
        columns: {\tt Correlate1Name}, {\tt Correlate2Name}, and {\tt CorrelatePair}.  These are
        respectively the name first column in the analysis, the name of the second column in
        the analysis, and a string of the form {\em Name1}.{\em Name2}.
\item {\bf switches:}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item {\tt -pipe=[input][,output] } --- The standard SDDS Toolkit pipe option.
    \item {\tt -columns={\em columnNames}} --- Specifies the names of columns to be included in the analysis.
        A comma-separated list of optionally wildcard-containing names may be given.
    \item {\tt -excludeColumns={\em columnNames}} --- Specifies the names of columns to be excluded from the
        analysis.  A comma-separated list of optionally wildcard-containing names may be given.
    \item {\tt -withOnly={\em columnName}} --- Specifies that one of the variables for each correlation will be
        the named column.  
    \item {\tt -rankOrder} --- Specifies computing rank-order correlations rather than standard correlations.
        This is considered more robust that standard correlations.
    \item {\tt -stDevOutlier[=limit={\em factor}][,passes={\em integer}]} --- Specifies standard-deviation-based
        outlier elimination on each pair of columns prior to computation of the correlation coefficient.
        Any pair of values is ignored if one or both values are outliers relative to the column from which they come.
        The {\tt limit} qualifier specifies the allowed deviation from the mean in standard deviations; the
        default is 1.  The {\tt passes} qualifier specifies how many times the outlier elimination (including
        recomputation of the mean and standard deviation) is performed; the default is 1.
